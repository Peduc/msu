	"text": "Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering technology. She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal.Six months ago, technology investors were complaining privately that bankers were lowballing stock prices when companies went public. Fast-forward to today; no one should be griping about overly conservative IPO prices.&#xA0;Okta&apos;s IPO multiple to 12-month trailing revenue13.6x&#xA0;Late Thursday, business software company Okta Inc. sold 11 million shares in its initial public offering. The IPO values Okta out of the gate at about 13.6 times its revenue over the past 12 months, based on its market value including stock options and other equity. &#xA0;Its shares opened at $23.56, up from the $17 IPO. That would be 18.8 times trailing 12-month revenue. This is not conservative.&#xA0;Okta has nice software, an experienced executive team, and its sales are growing quickly at a rate of 87 percent in the latest fiscal year. But we have whipsawed from last June, when a high-quality business software company, Twilio Inc., went public at 7.8 times trailing 12 month revenue to a lesser company like Okta going public at a much richer revenue multiple.Subjectively, Twilio has better software than Okta does. Both companies had nearly identical revenue and growth rates at their IPO. Twilio was barely free-cash-flow negative compared with Okta&apos;s free-cash-flow burn of $54 million in its most recent fiscal year.&#xA0;Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. also had an unjustifiable valuation at its IPO. That may have been a unique circumstance for a unique company. But not-so-unique MuleSoft Inc. went public last month also at a multiple of 13.5 times its 2016 revenue, or a valuation of $2.5 billion including outstanding equity.&#xA0;This is not normal.&#xA0;&#xA0;Yes, it&apos;s common for tech companies to have aggressive valuations at their IPOs. Sometimes it works out fine and the companies grow into their valuation. And sometimes it does not. What surprises me isn&apos;t necessarily the heady valuations for middling companies like Okta and MuleSoft but how much has changed so quickly with IPO market conditions and pricing dynamics.It shows investors want to buy shares of young public companies, and the demand is pushing IPO prices above what they would have been last year. If a company is considering an IPO, there are no excuses. It should do it now. Right now.&#xA0;The IPO market is recovering, and that is good. Time will tell, though, if the IPO market has overshot recovery and headed straight into a ditch.I didn&apos;t think it was possible for Cloudera Inc., whose technology helps companies wrangle digital data, to go public anywhere close to its $4.1 billion valuation from private market stock sales. That would be 15.7 times its revenue over the last year. I had the same skepticism about Dropbox Inc., which Bloomberg News has reported is considering an IPO&#xA0;potentially for later this year.Both companies have publicly traded peers trading at significantly lower valuations than they have as private companies. Cloudera and Dropbox seemed&#xA0;to be ripe for a big stumble on valuation -- likely the worst so far among significant tech companies making the transition from private&#xA0;to public markets.&#xA0;But I just don&apos;t know anymore.&#xA0;I officially quit trying to predict capital markets. Maybe Dropbox will wind up having a higher market value than Microsoft. Maybe any company can have a successful IPO right now. Send me your pitches!&#xA0;Click right now and read this important article from my Bloomberg News colleagues about how a number of high-profile tech companies and startups -- including Okta -- have recently turned down acquisitions and instead put their faith on receiving higher valuations "

	"text": "The shift of technology startup companies and talent into cities is taken for granted today, but I would never have predicted it even a decade ago.The leading-edge high-tech companies of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and even the early 2000s -- like Intel, Apple and Google -- were housed in corporate campuses in Silicon Valley. Microsoft had its headquarters in suburban Redmond, Washington; other high-tech companies clustered along the Route 128 suburbs outside of Boston, in the suburbs of Austin, Texas, or the office parks of North Carolina&#x2019;s Research Triangle. Back in the late 1980s, when I conducted my early studies of the geography of venture capital and high-tech industry with Martin Kenney, the lion&#x2019;s share of venture capital-backed startups were in these suburban areas.That geography has become much more urban. With nearly $6.5 billion in such investment, San Francisco topped the $4.2 billion that the San Jose metro (which encompasses Silicon Valley) received in 2012, ranking as the world&#x2019;s number-one location for venture capital investment that year. Greater New York took in more than $2 billion, the bulk of it in Lower Manhattan.Those figures grew even larger in 2013. In that year, the San Francisco metro took in a whopping $8.5 billion in venture capital investment, with $6.2 billion of that flowing into the city itself, compared with $4.8 billion in the San Jose metro. Venture capital investment in Greater New York grew to more than $3 billion.Across the U.S., more than half of this investment (54 percent) and nearly six in 10 startups (57 percent) were in urban ZIP codes in 2013. Roughly 60 percent of venture investment in the Bay Area went to dense, walkable neighborhoods in urban ZIP codes, and in New York, more than 80 percent did.In the ZIP codes that received venture capital investment nationwide, the share of workers who walked, biked or used transit to get to work was nearly twice the national average (16.6 percent in venture capital neighborhoods, versus 8.4 percent overall). More than a quarter of venture capital investment nationally was concentrated in neighborhoods where more than half of all workers walked, biked or used transit, and more than a third was located in neighborhoods where more than 30 percent did so.Indeed, urban density has become one of the most important factors in the propagation of high-tech startups and the attraction of venture capital investment. The amount of venture capital invested in startups is more strongly correlated with population density than it is with either the concentration of highly educated people or the concentration of the creative class, and only slightly less strongly correlated with population density than it is with the concentration of high-tech industry -- which is the very thing that attracts venture capital investment to begin with.Even when such investment flows to startups in smaller cities and suburbs, it tends to go to the ones that have the most urban characteristics. With more than $1.5 billion in investment, the leading center for venture capital investment in Silicon Valley is the densest part of Palo Alto surrounding Stanford University. Cambridge, Massachusetts, home to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, attracted close to $1 billion, more than the suburbs out along Route 128. Dense, walkable Santa Monica attracted double the amount of venture capital that the much larger but more sprawling city of Los Angeles received.The urban shift in technology startups extends beyond the U.S. Once a high-finance center with little in the way of tech, London is now home to thousands of high-tech companies and tens of thousands of jobs. Its startups pull in more than $800 million a year in venture capital, more than in Seattle or Austin. Beijing and Shanghai, Mumbai and Bangalore, Toronto, Paris, and Moscow all number among the world&#x2019;s 20 leading locations for venture capital investment and startup companies. Urban startup hubs are also emerging in Berlin, Amsterdam, Liverpool and Munich in Europe, and Tel Aviv and Amman, Jordan, in the Middle East. &#xA0;Startups and cities are a natural match. Urban areas provide the diversity, creative energy, cultural richness, vibrant street life and openness to new ideas that startup founders are looking for.While many large, well-established tech companies -- like Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., to name a few -- require large headquarter sites and remain in the suburbs, startups can make use of the adaptable work spaces that urban industrial and warehouse buildings provide.In the past, the most successful startups were those that focused on developing and manufacturing software or hardware, and the large facilities and campuses they required could be more cheaply accommodated in the suburbs.Today&#x2019;s hottest startups involve digital and social media"

It also brings the retail giant&#x2019;s voice-activated digital assistant -- Alexa -- to TV sets, potentially eliminating the need for consumers to buy a stand-alone Amazon Echo device, first released in 2014 and&#xA0;which has sold millions of units worldwide.&quot;This will allow millions more customers to access Alexa, meaning they can get answers to questions, use Alexa skills, manage their smart home, or even find things to watch and control playback,&quot; Jorrit Van der Meulen, vice president of Amazon Devices International, said in a press release.The U.K. is the first international region to offer the latest Fire TV Stick, which will cost about 40 pounds ($50) and comes with the Alexa Voice Remote. The latter device incorporates a built-in microphone to capture voice commands such as &quot;watch Netflix&quot; or field questions like &quot;do I need an umbrella today&quot;, similar to Apple Inc.&#x2019;s Siri remote, which ships with the latest Apple TV.&#xA0;Such devices are seen as a gateway to introducing artificial intelligence into the home, and are considered a key growth area for technology companies. Google last week brought its Google Home device to British homes, the first time its Amazon Echo rival had been made available outside of the U.S. Microsoft&#x2019;s digital assistant Cortana is built into its Windows 10 operating system by default, as well as the Xbox One games console.In the U.K., Amazon Fire TV Stick includes support for services such as the BBC iPlayer, and catch-up platforms from commercial broadcasters ITV, Channel 4 and Five.

	"text": "When Adam Selipsky took over as head of data-visualization company Tableau Inc. in September, the first thing he did was visit some of his biggest customers. None was clamoring for new features or fixes. They only wanted one thing: greater flexibility in buying the product, starting with a subscription plan.So Tableau, which makes software that helps companies turn complex databases into graphics and maps, is rolling out exactly that starting Thursday. Prices range from $35 to $70 a month. Customers can still buy the old way &#x2014;&#xA0;pay once to own it outright &#x2014; but Tableau will promote the subscription offer on its website and encourage customers to go that route.&#xA0;Beside making clients happy and enabling Tableau to catch up to rivals, the move is intended to please shareholders. Subscriptions make revenue more predictable and should help smooth out unexpected shortfalls, like those that sent the company&#x2019;s shares tumbling 55 percent in February 2016.&#xA0;At the same time, the shift will lower revenue and profit in the short term, because these deals get recognized over the&#xA0;duration of the subscription instead of entirely up front.Having a consistent revenue stream means ``you&apos;re not waiting to see what deals close at the end of the quarter,&quot; Selipsky,&#xA0;a former Amazon Web Services executive, said in an interview at Tableau&apos;s Seattle headquarters. With fewer initial costs, the subscription model also helps win customers with tight budgets, he said. &quot;If they are saying `Hey, we&apos;d really like to enable 1,000 users on Tableau,&apos; in a tight budget environment it&apos;s a lot easier to do that if you are paying a fraction of the fee&quot; each month.In offering a subscription service, Tableau is trying to get up to speed with the rest of the industry. Companies like Adobe Systems Inc. and Tableau rival Microsoft Corp. started making the move years ago. About 65 to 70 percent of software vendors have changed to subscriptions either in the cloud or in the customer&apos;s own data center, said Jim Hare, an analyst at Gartner Inc. Gartner predicts that number will reach 80 percent by 2020 -- it may be even sooner, Hare said.&#xA0;&quot;Tableau is late to the game,&quot; he said. One of the challenges Tableau faced was being viewed as not &quot;very flexible when it came to pricing.&quot;&#xA0;Selipsky expects subscription adoption will expand &quot;significantly.&quot; The company forecasts as much as 35 percent of sales will come from subscription sources this year and eventually they will account for the vast majority of revenue.&#xA0;&quot;This is really a risk-reduction program for customers -- it&apos;s like the difference between dating and getting married,&quot; Selipsky said.&#xA0;&#xA0;Tableau&apos;s cloud customers already pay this way&#xA0;and certain large customers who asked for it specifically have also been trying out the subscription model, Selipsky said.One of those is Brown-Forman Corp., the maker of Jack Daniel&apos;s whiskey. The company had &#xA0;some employees who had been using Tableau for several years. So when it&#xA0;decided to buy one data visualization product for the whole firm, Tableau was one of three under consideration, said Chief Information Officer Tim Nall. But Brown-Forman only wanted a subscription product, he said.&#xA0;&quot;We&apos;d already gone the subscription route to what we consider more flexibility,&quot; with software from companies like Salesforce.com Inc. and Workday Inc., Nall said. He told Tableau that giving Brown-Forman the ability to buy this way before it was rolled out widely might help push the decision in their favor. Currently, around 1,000 of the company&apos;s about 4,500 workers are using some form of Tableau, and the flexible model gives Nall the ability to bring more on as needed.&#xA0;Tableau shares plummeted in February 2016 when the company reported license revenue growth had slowed dramatically. After recovering some losses, the stock steadily declined during the last four months of the year. The company blamed new salespeople for failing to secure deals. Analysts cited more competition from vendors like Microsoft. That rivalry has pushed Tableau to finally focus on subscriptions, said Gartner&apos;s Hare.&#xA0;&apos;&apos;People&#xA0;were looking at Microsoft and saying, `if Microsoft is only charging me $10 per user, per month why are you charging me $2,000 to buy it?&apos; even if the products aren&apos;t exactly the same,&apos;&apos; Hare said.&#xA0;This year, the picture "

Something was amiss; the beer wasn&#x2019;t fermenting at the usual temperature. Luckily, a software system triggered a warning&#xA0;and he fixed the problem.&quot;We would have had to dump an entire batch,&quot; the brewmaster said. When beer is your bottom line, that&apos;s a calamity.The software that spotted the temperature anomaly is from Microsoft Corp. and it&apos;s a new type that uses a powerful&#xA0;form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. What makes it potentially revolutionary is that Deschutes rented the tool over the internet from&#xA0;Microsoft&apos;s cloud-computing service.&#xA0;Day to day, Deschutes uses the system to decide when to stop one part of the brewing process and begin another, saving time while producing better beer, the company says.The Bend, Oregon-based brewer&#xA0;is among a growing number of enterprises&#xA0;using new combinations of AI tools and cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.&apos;s Google.&#xA0;C-SPAN is using Amazon image-recognition to automatically identify who is in the government TV programs it broadcasts.&#xA0;Insurance company USAA is planning to use similar technology from Google to assess damage from car accidents and floods without sending in human insurance adjusters. The American Heart Association is using Amazon voice recognition to power a chat bot registering people for a charity&#xA0;walk in June.AI software used to&#xA0;require&#xA0;thousands of processors&#xA0;and lots of power, so only the largest technology companies and research universities could afford to use it. An early Google system cost more than $1 million and used about 1,000 computers. Deschutes has no time for such technical feats. It invests mostly in brewing tanks, not data centers. Only when Microsoft, Amazon and Google began offering AI software over the internet in recent years did these ideas seem plausible.&#xA0;Amazon is the public cloud leader right now, but each company has its strengths. Democratizing access to powerful AI software is the latest battleground, and could decide which tech giant emerges as the ultimate winner&#xA0;in a cloud infrastructure market worth $25 billion this year, according to researcher IDC.&quot;There&apos;s a new generation of applications that require a lot more intense data science and machine learning. There is a race for who is going to provide the tools for that,&quot; said Diego Oppenheimer, chief executive officer&#xA0;of Algorithmia Inc., a startup that runs a marketplace for algorithms that do some of the same things as Microsoft, Amazon and Google&apos;s technology.If the tools become widespread, they could transform work as more automation lets companies get more done with the same human work force.&#xA0;C-SPAN, which runs three TV stations and five web channels, previously used a combination of closed-caption transcripts and manpower to determine when a new speaker started talking and who it was. It was so time-consuming, the network only&#xA0;tagged about half of the events it broadcast. C-SPAN began toying with Amazon&apos;s image-recognition cloud service the same day it launched, said Alan Cloutier, technical manager for the network&apos;s archives.Now the network is using it to match all speakers against a database it maintains of 99,000 government officials. C-SPAN plans to enter all the data into a system that will let users search its website for things like Bernie Sander&apos;s healthcare speeches or all times Devin Nunes mentions Russia.&#xA0;As companies try to better analyze, optimize and predict everything&#xA0;from sales cycles to product development, they are trying AI techniques like deep learning, a type of machine learning that&apos;s produced impressive results in recent years. IDC expects spending on such cognitive systems and AI&#xA0;to grow 55 percent a year for the next five years. The cloud-based portion of that should grow even faster, IDC analyst David Schubmehl said.&#xA0;&quot;In the fullness of time deep learning will be one of the most popular workloads on EC2,&quot; said Matt Wood, Amazon Web Services&apos; general manager for deep learning and AI, referring to its flagship cloud service, Elastic Compute Cloud.Pinterest Inc. uses Amazon&apos;s image-recognition service to let users take a picture of an item -- say a friend&apos;s shoes -- and see similar footwear. Schools in India and Tacoma, Washington, are using Microsoft&apos;s Azure Machine Learning to predict which students may&#xA0;drop out, and farmers in India are using it to figure out when to plant peanut crops, based on monsoon data.

Computer app developers and city governments then use the data to map out networks that link these informal routes with traditional city buses and trains.&#xA0;Devin de Vries&#x201C;The market for smart-city solutions is just heating up,&#x201D; said Kim Fennel, the chief executive officer of deCarta Inc., a digital mapping company that&#x2019;s now part of Uber. Fennel, along with EBay co-founder&#xA0;Pierre Omidyar, backed the startup with 1.76 million pounds ($2.15 million) last year.While commuters in the developed world can easily check the internet to track rail schedules and hail cabs from their mobile phones, life isn&#x2019;t as simple for people in emerging markets. Routes taken by informal transport including motorbikes and the three-wheel passenger cars known as tuk-tuks can change without notice and have no set times. That&#x2019;s if you know where to find them, and can figure out where they&#x2019;re going, often in vehicles that are over-packed, unroadworthy or have little regard for traffic rules.South African city authorities such as the Municipality of Tshwane, which includes the&#xA0;capital Pretoria, as well as the Gautrain transit system in Johannesburg and the University of Cape Town, are paying for the information, according to co-founder Devin de Vries. Minibus taxis are widely used in South African cities.App writers get free access up to a point, then pay fees.WhereIsMyTransport&#x2019;s&#xA0;staff jump onto passenger vans to track routes or mine global positioning data gathered from mobile phones to build on the platform, said de Vries, who started the venture after winning a Microsoft competition at the University of Cape Town that sent him to Silicon Valley for a spell.Commuters board a mini-taxi in Cape Town.WhereIsMyTransport is far from the first to tackle the&#xA0;problem of urban mapping in rapidly changing cities.Digital mapping has spawned several rival systems.

Zippr, created in Hyderabad, India, changes addresses to 8-digit codes that are overlaid on a Google map to improve its accuracy, the company said.&#x201C;Startups need to devise innovative revenue models because statistically-significant data takes a while to accrue and can run into privacy hurdles,&#x201D; said Aditya Vuchi, founder of Zippr. &#x201C;It requires scale and coverage, which are hard to create in the early days.&#x201D;WhereIsMyTransport has&#xA0;more than 200 projects signed up to the platform including apps "

The new regulations, which come into force Thursday, will affect roughly 9,000 firms employing more than 15 million people, almost half the U.K. workforce. The national pay gap stands at 18.1 percent,&#xA0;the Office for National Statistics estimates.Employers will publish figures from a &#x201C;snapshot&#x201D; period in April, calculating the median and mean pay gaps, the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the payroll and&#xA0;the gaps reflected in any bonuses -- including the proportions of male and female bonus recipients.

Better goods and services.Now we may have too little of that good thing, as big&#xA0;corporations gobble up the economic pie. Market concentration has reached a three-decade high and, since the late 1990s, has increased in more than 75 percent of U.S. industries, according to a working paper given last week at the University of Chicago&apos;s Booth School of Business. Market concentration is&#xA0;how much of a market, such as the wireless or&#xA0;automobile market, the leaders in that industry control, by revenue.At the same time, the federal government has brought significantly fewer antitrust cases, according to the paper, titled&#xA0;&#x201C;Is There a Concentration Problem in America?&#x201D; In 2014, the Department of Justice didn&apos;t open any cases against monopolies at all, and&#xA0;opened just three in 2015. That compares to&#xA0;22 cases in 1994.&#xA0;&#xA0;Gustavo Grullon, a finance professor at Rice University&apos;s business school and one of the paper&apos;s three authors, acknowledged they can&#x2019;t infer a causal relationship between the increased market concentration and the decline in the number of antitrust cases, but said he thinks the correlation is strong enough to require &#x201C;serious attention from regulators.&#x201D;&#xA0;The other two authors are also business school professors, from Cornell University, and York University, in Canada.&#xA0;Their&#xA0;research was cited by a&#xA0;recent Wall Street Journal investing column. &#xA0;In the most recent draft of the working paper, the researchers, who had already found increasing market concentration, set out to determine what&apos;s driving the trend. The data they discovered led them to reject several of their hypotheses, including that the uptick was a result of consolidation of companies in unprofitable or distressed &#xA0;industries, such as&#xA0;publishing and textiles. The data did suggest, aside from antitrust enforcement, that patents are serving as&#xA0;&#x201C;technological barriers to entry,&#x201D; keeping out potential competitors.&#x201C;It is an important aspect of the economy, and it&#x2019;s the responsibility of agencies to figure out if this is an issue or not,&#x201D; Grullon said.During Bill Clinton&apos;s presidency, the Justice Department brought a higher number of monopoly cases under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, perhaps most notably the 1998 monopoly and anti-competitive practices lawsuit against Microsoft Corp.&#xA0;In all, the&#xA0;Justice Department averaged about 13 cases a year during Clinton&#x2019;s two terms. This period coincided with a sharp decrease in market concentration.Under George W. Bush, the department averaged three cases a&#xA0;year. As a candidate, Barack Obama accused the Bush administration of being too lax when it came to antitrust enforcement, but no crackdown came in his own administration. To the contrary, the government averaged just two antitrust cases a&#xA0;year under&#xA0;Obama. Grullon said market concentration rose dramatically over both of their presidencies. An early landmark Section 2 case was the Justice Department&apos;s 1909 lawsuit against&#xA0;John D. Rockefeller&apos;s&#xA0;Standard Oil Company, which ultimately led to&#xA0;the company&apos;s forced breakup.A delivery truck from the Standard Oil Company delivers fuel in New York in&#xA0;1930.&#x201C;When you have significant economic power, that can bring political power and anti-democratic pressures,&quot; said Maurice Stucke, a law professor at the University of Tennessee and a former&#xA0;Justice Department attorney. &quot;We&#x2019;re starting to see highly concentrated industries, profits accruing to a handful of firms, and fewer startups. And then you look at the impacts it could have on innovation and wealth inequality.&#x201D;&#xA0;The Obama administration did block several mergers in its&#xA0;second term, stopping mega-deals like Anthem Inc.&apos;s merger with Cigna Corp. Stucke said the federal government needs to crack down harder&#xA0;on&#xA0;mergers, which can&#xA0;contribute to increased market concentration.&#xA0;Stucke, who spoke at last week&apos;s conference, said attendees were interested in how President Donald Trump might approach antitrust matters.President Trump stumped as a populist insurgent, telling voters he would investigate Amazon.com Inc. for possible antitrust violations and blo"

One common scenario, she says, is widows or widowers falling prey to romantic&#xA0;scams. Loneliness leaves many seniors vulnerable, and &#x201C;human sexuality is very much a factor,&#x201D; says Johnson,&#xA0;50, who has a law degree. One client is in his early 70s and continues to give money to a 23-year-old girlfriend.&#xA0;He knows he is depleting his emergency funds, she says, but &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t make him stop. From my vantage point, it&#x2019;s exploitation. From his viewpoint, it&#x2019;s love.&#x201D;Scammers target the elderly because they represent an attractive pool of wealth and may not know a lot about how the internet can be used to rip them off. Some are suffering from cognitive decline. The people Johnson typically used to see being&#xA0;scammed were&#xA0;80-year-old women living alone without close family. Now, &#x201C;the internet really allows everybody to be victimized,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;More and more with online, I&#x2019;m getting men as well.&#x201D;Some 17 percent of seniors say they&#x2019;ve been the victim of financial exploitation, according to&#xA0;studies cited in a report&#xA0;last year by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The annual tally for money lost in elder financial abuse was $2.9 billion, a&#xA0;2011 MetLife study estimated, based on public data. Experts suspect that the vast majority of abuse is not reported and that the true tally is far higher.The number of elder abuse cases referred to U.S. Bank&#x2019;s complaints-and-investigations team&#xA0;more than doubled from 2014 to 2015, after the bank launched an education program for employees. It rose an additional&#xA0;20 percent last year. In 2015 the tally of assets considered &#x201C;at risk&#x201D; among suspected victims of fraud at the bank was more than $75.4 million. Last year it was $34.6 million.For longtime users of social media, all of this is a reminder to watch what we, and our parents, reveal, so we don&#x2019;t wind up in Johnson&#x2019;s next interview. Meanwhile, here&#x2019;s this one, edited for length and clarity.With one client in his early 70s, it came to my attention when he was trying to withdraw money for his 23-year-old girlfriend so she could have a funeral for her mother. He had already given her almost $300,000 over the course of eight months. She was allegedly all alone, with no family, and said her mother had just died of cancer.We did a quick search on Facebook and Google and discovered that her mother had posted pictures of her new dogs two hours earlier, and there were lots of pictures of this client&#x2019;s girlfriend and all of her siblings. Everything she had said was a lie.When we&#x2019;re working with people whose mental capacity is not an issue, there&#x2019;s often not a lot the state or the police will do, unless the client is willing to do something on their own behalf. With these cases, we have &#x201C;come to Jesus&#x201D; conversations. The adviser, who was reasonably close with this client, laid it all out&#x2014;this is what we found, we&#x2019;re concerned you&#x2019;re blowing through your money.&#xA0;He told the client that his money was not going to sustain him and that they needed to look at his finances and make some changes based on what he had left.&#xA0;He wired the girlfriend&#xA0;more money, about $8,000 over the next week.&#xA0;It appears that he is still providing money to a third party.It is a huge driving factor, and we see it more and more&#x2014;more than anything else&#x2014;especially in men. They are of an age and a demographic when they are used to being taken care of a bit, and often the caregiver es"

	"text": "For two days, the crowd sits in darkness in plush theater seats, watching the church stage. There are smoke machines and LED screens, harnessed climbers scaling a scaffold &#x201C;mountain&#x201D; and raising their arms in symbolic victory over the startup world&#x2019;s arduous climb. There&#x2019;s talk of destiny-defining &#x201C;exits.&#x201D; Of Jesus and his disciples: &#x201C;The most successful startup in history!&#x201D; Of the parable of the talents, in which two servants are lauded by their master for turning a profit with money he staked them: &#x201C;The first recorded instance of venture capital and investment banking in history!&#x201D; Of ancient business elites: &#x201C;A church is the oldest marketplace in the history of the world.&#x201D; Of the promised land of angel investing, where divinely inspired entrepreneurs dwell: &#x201C;Because God creates things, too!&#x201D; Mark Burnett, the producer of&#xA0;The Apprentice&#xA0;and&#xA0;Shark Tank, shows up to remind everyone that &#x201C;the Bible is full of merchants and people doing work.&#x201D;At last, near the end of Unpolished&#xA0;2015, a faith and entrepreneurship conference hosted by Crossroads, an evangelical church in Cincinnati, the marquee event begins: the final round of a pitch contest. Organizers have selected three prospective company founders out of more than 100 entrants, each of whom submitted a minute-long video pitch deck. One of the finalists, Lyden Foust, a 25-year-old ethnographer, presents his entry on the LED screens flanking the church stage. With his chiseled jawline, tightly trimmed beard, and three-button henley, he looks like an L.L. Bean model, save perhaps for his rectangular glasses. In a voice-over, he describes his vision to divide the world&#x2019;s cities by &#x201C;vibe,&#x201D; calling his idea &#x201C;Google Maps wearing a mood ring.&#x201D; The cityscape of Nashville rolls past, overlaid in swaths of color: blue for blue-collar neighborhoods, brown for yuppie ones, green for hipster, purple for commercial, teal for family, yellow for artsy.Every successful pitch deck, like every successful religion, includes an origin story, and Foust&#x2019;s is no different. He recounts booking a place in Nashville through Airbnb Inc., only to find the house situated between a strip club and a manufacturing plant. While retrieving something from his car, he turned to see a man pointing a gun at his face. &#x201C;I just handed him my wallet,&#x201D; Foust says. The robbery led to an epiphany: Why not mine social data to tell people what a neighborhood is really like?The idea isn&#x2019;t entirely new: An app that launched in 2014 with a similar aim (albeit a different crowd-sourcing methodology), SketchFactor, foundered after being widely criticized for appearing to help white people avoid black neighborhoods. But at this point, Foust&#x2019;s product is pure concept. He has no employees to build it, only a name, Spatial. The other finalists pitch a family-run app-development company and a board-game-rental app; then the judging is turned over to the audience of 1,200 aspiring entrepreneurs. Foust&#x2019;s idea prevails, and Brian Tome, Crossroads&#x2019; senior pastor, hands him an oversize check for $3,000. Soon after, Foust will begin the next stage of the church&#x2019;s path to entrepreneurial success, applying for a spot in a member-funded, Bible-based accelerator program, beginning in a few months, that&#x2019;s designed to train startups in how to raise money and grow.Finally, the house lights come up. At the end of the aisles, attendants await, holding pails overflowing with packets of apple seeds. &#x201C;God&#x2019;s placed a seed in you. And he wants to see it come to fruitfulness,&#x201D; Tome says to the crowd, his spiked and styled dirty-blond hair and untucked plaid shirt lending him the air of an aging film star. Bowing his head, he prays, asking God to lead everyone to &#x201C;the right seed that will bring forth the right fruit at the right time in every business.&#x201D;It&#x2019;s a remarkable altar call: Those who feel inspired are to take these seeds from the attendants and go forth, claiming their spiritual destinies&#x2009;&#x2026;&#x2009;as entrepreneurs. At the edge of the waist-high stage, people mingle, hugging and holding hands. Others bow their head or kneel under the outstretched hands of strangers to receive prayer. Foust joins them, walking down the aisle and asking for blessings and prayers at the start of his entrepreneurship journey.Named the fastest-growing church in America in 2015, Crossroads has been described by the&#xA0;Cincinnati Business Courier&#xA0;as both an entrepreneurial church and a church for entrepreneurs.

Trump traveled in his own Boeing 757 when he ran for president, and he once operated an airline providing shuttle service on the East Coast.Trump met with military leaders including Everhart at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida after tweeting earlier that month: &#x201C;Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!&#x201D;But Trump didn&#x2019;t realize the $4 billion wasn&#x2019;t just the cost for two modified 747-8 passenger planes built by Boeing Co., Everhart recounted in the interview Tuesday at Bloomberg&#x2019;s New York headquarters. It also includes the modifications needed to outfit it with advanced security and communications systems and funds to pay for decades of operations and support.&#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Sir -- because it&#x2019;s amortized over a 30-year program,&#x2019;&#x201D; Everhart recalled. &#x201C;&#x2018;It&#x2019;s just not two airplanes&#x2019;&#x201D; to replace two aging aircraft, but &#x201C;&#x2018;it&#x2019;s everything that comes with those airplanes over a 30-year period.&#x201D;&#x2019;Still, Everhart said Trump asked good questions, such as &#x201C;Why can&#x2019;t it be a two-engine versus a four-engine&#x201D; aircraft?Everhart said he told Trump a four-engine aircraft was needed because &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got to support your role as commander-in-chief.&#x201D; He said he told the president-elect that &#x201C;this is an alternate flying White House&#x201D; that has to support continuity of government operations &#x201C;no matter what happens,&#x201D; including during an attack on the U.S.Businessweek: Trump Force One Is Ready for TakeoffThe general said the requirements for the presidential aircraft are set by the White House Military Office. A lot of time and money have been spent reviewing those, Everhart said.Trump also asked, &#x201C;Why can&#x2019;t I go to another vendor?&#x201D; While the Air Force found Boeing was the only U.S. aircraft manufacturer able to provide the planes, Everhart said Trump was &#x201C;thinking business in his head&#x201D; because &#x201C;he wanted to come from a position of negotiations to try and get the price down.&#x201D;Trump has a history as a shrewd buyer of second-hand aircraft that he retrofits to his gold-plated standards. In fact, the Boeing 757 that ferried him on the campaign trail was a hand-me-down from billionaire Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen. The hourly shuttle service, which he purchased from the failing Eastern Airlines in 1988, was less successful, lasting just four years.After meeting Everhart, Trump decided to bring in Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and &#x201C;&#x2018;talk to him about this pricing,&#x2019;&#x201D; the general recalled.In February, Trump claimed he negotiated $1 billion in savings, an assertion that the service said at the time it couldn&#x2019;t verify. &#x201C;They were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One,&#x201D; Trump said at a rally on in Florida that month. &#x201C;Can you believe this?&#x201D;Instead, Trump said, &#x201C;we got that price down by over $1 billion, and I probably haven&#x2019;t spoken, to be honest with you, for more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in, who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. But I told Boeing it&#x2019;s not good enough. We&#x2019;re not going to do it. The price is still too high.&#x201D;The Government Accountability Office estimated in a report last week that the program will cost $3 billion, based on the Air Force&#x2019;s latest estimates independent of Trump&#x2019;s efforts.The Air Force and Boeing are still negotiating the price of the two basic airframes, Everhart said."

	"text": "The new way foreign worker visas are doled out in the U.S. is poised to benefit some of the biggest technology companies, like Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc., while punishing outsourcing firms that developed a disproportionate dependence on the program.The administration is increasing scrutiny&#xA0;on H-1B visa applications for low-level computer programmers, focusing enforcement on the heaviest users of the program, and warning applicants not to discriminate against American workers. The&#xA0;size and scope of the program remains unchanged for now.&#xA0;There are 85,000 H-1B visas distributed through a random lottery each year, and applicants rush to file by the start of the process, this year on April 3. Outsourcing firms often recruit lower-skilled workers through the program, so they may not get as many visas under the new rules. That means more for everyone else, including U.S. tech giants. What some see as a crackdown may actually be a boon for these companies, according to&#xA0;Rod Bourgeois, head of research at DeepDive Equity Research. &quot;If Indian firms have a harder time getting basic programming jobs approved for the visa process, then the firms truly hiring people with high skills and specialized knowledge will benefit,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;See which countries get the most H-1B visas.Alphabet Inc.&apos;s Google told some of its workers on Monday not to worry about the changes, saying its software engineering roles don&apos;t fall into the job categories included in the administration&apos;s new guidance. Other big U.S. technology companies didn&apos;t say anything publicly. That&apos;s tantamount to a round of applause compared with the industry&apos;s reaction to Trump&apos;s executive orders restricting immigration from a handful of Muslim-majority countries. Dozens of companies supported lawsuits against the orders. When the first one was issued in late January, Google told some staff to return to the U.S. in case they couldn&apos;t get back in later, and thousands of employees protested.Carl Shusterman, a former attorney for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service,&#xA0;called&#xA0;the H-1B changes &quot;a subtle threat&quot; against outsourcing companies. &#xA0;Seven companies had more than 1,000 visa applications for the lowest-level computer programmers certified by the Department of Labor in 2015, the last year for which numbers are available. All of them provide outsourcing services,&#xA0;such as&#xA0;IT, HR, payroll and accounting, for other companies. One&#xA0;of them -- HCL America Inc. -- is headquartered in the U.S., with most of the rest based in India.&#xA0;&quot;The top 15 job shops are all pretty much all from India. They get 85 percent of the H-1Bs. If they cut that number, then the American firms will get the bigger slice of the pie,&quot; Shusterman said. &quot;A lot of the Apples or Googles are paying over $100,000 a year. They&apos;re going after top talent. This memo is really going after the lowest paid people.&quot;Read more: A Q&amp;A explainer on the fight over U.S. visas.The American technology industry is happy to go along with the framing of H-1B reform as a&#xA0;matter of cutting down on bad actors. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re taking that out of the system you&#x2019;re able to take the program back to its true stated purpose,&#x201D; said Michael Hayes, government affairs manager for the Consumer Technology Association, in February. &#x201C;Removing the abuse lets you see what the future needs of the system are.&#x201D; He declined to comment on the recent changes.Silicon Valley companies say they use H-1B visas differently than outsourcing firms. Their common refrain is that its bad policy to let foreign students&#xA0;earn advanced degrees from the best U.S. universities, then send them away to work in other countries. But that&#x2019;s not the main use of the program. Ron Hira, who studies immigration policy at Howard University,&#xA0;shared analysis with Congress&#xA0;last year that&#xA0;looked at the H-1B program from 2005 to 2012.&#xA0;Only two of the top twenty H-1B recipients "

Once compared with Apple Inc. for its sleek smartphones and charismatic leadership, the Chinese startup is seeking an image makeover as it tries to recover from a sales-growth slide.And the brand its billionaire co-founder Lei Jun wants to be compared with: Costco Wholesale Corp., the Issaquah, Washington-based warehouse retailer that sells everything from wine and diamond rings to bulging boxes of cereal and fruit at knockdown prices. Xiaomi&#x2019;s revenue&#xA0;will probably reach $15 billion this year as&#xA0;the Beijing-based maker of products ranging from pens and air purifiers to TVs and smartphones adopts a new business model and fine-tunes operations, Lei, 47, said in a recent interview.Lei Jun&#x201C;We are not Apple,&#x201D; Lei, clad in a black polo shirt and blue jeans, said at Xiaomi&#x2019;s&#xA0;Bengaluru office in India, its biggest overseas market. &#x201C;We have the same value system as Costco. We want users to enjoy better products at an affordable price.&#x201D;While Apple commands premium prices and enjoys the highest margins in the brutally competitive $425 billion global smartphone industry, Costco sells merchandise at razor-thin profits while fueling earnings from its 35 million annual memberships. As Xiaomi embraces a new strategy to fuel growth, Lei&#x2019;s goal is to pull in more revenue from apps and services, which delivered $1 billion in sales from 10 million-plus monthly active users last year.It&#x2019;s a far different strategy than the one it used to claim the top spot among China&#x2019;s smartphone makers and a valuation of $45 billion that made it, briefly, the most valuable startup in the world. Instead of the online flash sales and inexpensively-sourced components that it used to disrupt the mobile industry, Lei wants to bring internet-inspired efficiency to offline commerce.&#xA0;He&#x2019;s also turning to India to revive Xiaomi&#x2019;s fortunes as China grows more competitive.Here, 20-something workers in denim jeans and T-shirts huddle in groups or sit behind shiny white desks separated by foot-high red, yellow and green partitions.

	"text": "This year, Android is donning the crown of the world&apos;s No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. As an Android user, I don&apos;t really mind&#xA0;-- but there are ominous aspects to its growing dominance&#xA0;and a possibility that better technology may not get&#xA0;the recognition it deserves.StatCounter, the web analytics company,&#xA0;reports&#xA0;that Android devices accounted for 37.93 percent of global internet traffic, just ahead of Windows&apos; 37.91 percent. That&apos;s remarkable, considering that most people use some version of Windows on computers at work. Given the mobile operating system&apos;s momentum as people spend more time on their phones, the scale will soon tip further in Android&apos;s favor.On the revenue side, Apple&apos;s mobile operating system, iOS, has long been the dominant moneymaker. AppAnnie, a firm that keeps tabs on the app economy, predicts, however, that it will be displaced by Android this year. While Apple&apos;s App Store will still collect almost twice as much revenue as the Google Play store, owned by Google&apos;s parent Alphabet Inc., third-party Android app stores will make sure that the Google operating system tops iOS.Alphabet doesn&apos;t say how much it&apos;s making from Android, nor does Apple break out the App Store in its financial reports. Last year, Oracle, which sued Google for copyright infringement, disclosed&#xA0;a number in court: It claimed the Android revenue reached $33 billion between 2008 and 2015. There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from&#xA0;Google&apos;s main business -- ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. That revenue stream, which Apple doesn&apos;t have, may well compensate for Alphabet&apos;s lack of control over the third-party stores.Android is the ugly duckling of the operating-system world. It&apos;s technically open-source and free to use, so device makers like to tweak it. That creates chaos and often lowers the quality of the user experience, which advanced users try to fix by messing with the system themselves. Because of the variety of Android flavors and hardware on which the system runs, updates are intermittent&#xA0;for most users -- those who don&apos;t own a Google-branded or co-branded device. Though the general interface design has approved in recent years, it can sometimes feel raw and less convenient than that of Apple&apos;s sleek iOS. Many, including myself, like Android because it can be an exciting set of building blocks for a little boy (or girl).That it&apos;s winning the operating system race is exciting to those who, like me, have argued that the open-source approach is the most progressive. Besides, Alphabet&apos;s push to turn phones into virtual reality devices is an interesting vision for the future of a gadget that&apos;s getting harder and harder to improve. But Android&apos;s emerging dominance is also worrying for two reasons.One is privacy. The reason Android is free is that Google, Alphabet&apos;s main unit, is an advertising company that collects lots of data about users.&#xA0;Given the erosion of privacy protections, I&apos;m not sure Google is the platform on which I&apos;d like to do most of my personal computing.The other problem with Android&apos;s ascendancy is that it&apos;s not a good operating system for desktops and laptops.The three major operating-system makers -- Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft -- have chosen distinct approaches to handling different kinds of devices.Apple creates a separate system for every device category -- the MacOS for laptops and desktops, the iOS for phones and tablets, and separate systems for wearables and set-top boxes.Alphabet&#xA0;is trying to make a mobile system usable on devices equipped with a hardware keyboard. Android apps run on Chromebooks, and Samsung&apos;s latest Galaxy S8 smartphone can be turned into a desktop machine by using a special "

That&apos;s the third major funding round for Cohesity, bringing the total investments in the company to more than $160 million. The new infusion will help the startup expand internationally while also improving its lineup with more engineers, according to Mohit Aron, chief executive officer and founder.Cohesity is expanding its reach to attract more businesses looking for new ways to handle the growing reams of data being produced every day. While the company doesn&apos;t disclose sales, the startup said it has been roughly doubling the number of customers every quarter. Its products became publicly available in late 2015.Cohesity is targeting the &quot;secondary&quot; part of the storage industry that takes care of data that needs to be available for projects that might include analytics -- but not necessarily at the highest speeds. This storage, which also aims to reduce complexity, is offered via gear that looks like flat boxes and includes computing and networking capabilities, often referred to as hyperconverged products. The startup also has agreements to let its technology work with major cloud providers Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.&quot;There&apos;s a lot of market demand,&quot;&#xA0;said Bill Coughran, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a Cohesity board member.GV participated in an earlier funding round and Sequoia co-led Cohesity&apos;s initial funding.

His flat-screen TV, home theater system, 3D printers, phones, tablets, computers and furniture were either hackathon prizes or purchased with hackathon earnings. Stashed under his leather couch &#x2014; which he&#x2019;d bought with an Amazon gift card &#x2014; was a thick stack of 2- and 3-foot-long cardboard checks commemorating his most cherished wins. &#x201C;The only non-schwag I have are shoes,&#x201D; he said.With his gray hoodie and close-cropped goatee, 33-year-old Ma looks like any of the thousands of computer programmers roaming the city, but he&#x2019;s part of an elite corps. He and about a dozen friends travel the hackathon circuit. They build apps, connected devices and other products during all-night, fiercely competitive programming contests where sleep is scarce and caffeine is plentiful. The sessions are usually sponsored by corporations, and top prizes mean serious cash. (We explore hackathons for the younger set on this week&#x2019;s Decrypted podcast; subscribe here on iTunes.)Some of the hackers have jobs. Some do contracting work. Some have corporate sponsors. Almost all of them are working on a pet startup idea. For Ma and a few others, hackathons are a job. Ma knows he would make more money if he had a more traditional career. He just doesn&#x2019;t want one.&#x201C;I have my time to myself and the freedom to work on whatever it is I want,&#x201D; said Ma during a long lunch on a sunny Tuesday in March. Ma said he has considered offers from Google, Facebook and Uber over the years, but passed every time because he likes calling his own shots. Intel sponsors his work by sending him technology for company-related projects, and he also has an occasional gig consulting for large companies. He likes the setup because it allows him to travel and work on his own schedule.Brian Clark, 27, supported himself on hackathon earnings for more than two years. (He and Ma don&#x2019;t know each other.) He&#x2019;s working on his fourth startup idea now, and says he carves out time for competitions because they help him hone skills and earn money quickly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d much rather earn that money in two days so I don&#x2019;t have to take the programming job for two months,&#x201D; Clark said.At one hackathon sponsored by Kmart and Sears, he built a mobile gifting app. None of his friends liked the idea, so he engineered it on his own and ended up winning $6,000 for fewer than four hours of work. Another time, when his bank account was down to zero and he was sleeping on a friend&#x2019;s couch in Oakland, he entered a hackathon out of desperation.&#x201C;It was win it&#xA0;or apply for a job,&#x201D; said Clark. He and some friends spent a little more than a day building a tool enabling developers to troubleshoot mobile apps by tracking user behavior. &#x201C;Out of 800 teams, I won first for $40,000.&#x201D;Over the past three years, Ma has traveled to more than 100 hackathons, and his strategy is down to a science. He knows how to maximize his time and prizes. He enters competitions based on the quality of the sponsors (read: big money), the location (unless airfare is covered, he&#x2019;s not inclined to leave the Bay Area) and which of his friends are planning to go.The cooler and newer the technology being promoted, the more interesting the hackathon is. Ma and Clark both look for events that will help them continue their education by practicing new skills.A few days before each hackathon, Ma checks that all his favorite programs and tools are up to date. Usually updates take 15 to 30 minutes, but sometimes there&#x2019;s a glitch, a program fails and an update can take a couple of hours. The times he hasn&#x2019;t done the prep work, like at a Smart Cities event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, have created chaos during the hackathon.&#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t know we needed an update and all the sample code stopped working,&#x201D; said Ma. The oversight cost his team several hours to correct. "

A first step came at the end of March, when the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services department issued guidelines making it harder for companies to bring foreign technology workers to the U.S. using the H-1B visa program.It allows companies to recruit 85,000 employees from abroad each year for specialty positions in fields including technology, science, medicine, architecture -- even fashion modeling. It took less than a week for applicants to exhaust that allotment in 2016, and technology companies including Facebook Inc., Google Inc., Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. have sought to increase the number available. People from India receive more H-1Bs than any other nationality.For H-1B visas given out in the 2017 lottery beginning April 3, the government now requires additional information for entry-level computer programmers, to prove the jobs are complicated and require advanced knowledge and experience. Computer programmers made up about 12 percent of all H-1B applications certified by the Department of Labor in 2015. In March, the immigration department suspended a program that expedited visa processing for certain skilled workers who paid extra, which some analysts saw as a first step to dismantling the H-1B program altogether.Efforts to overhaul U.S. visa programs could have huge implications for Silicon Valley.Apart from the best-known H-1B, companies use a variety of visas to bring in workers from abroad, including the B-1 for temporary business visitors and the L-1 for managers, executives and specialized workers of international companies.They were designed to allow U.S. companies to hire temporary workers from other countries when they couldn&#x2019;t find qualified people domestically.&#xA0;"

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency on Friday made it harder for companies to bring overseas tech workers to the U.S. using the H-1B work visa. On Monday, the agency&#xA0;issued a memo laying out new measures to combat what it called &quot;fraud and abuse&quot; in the program. The Justice Department also warned employers applying for the visas not to discriminate against U.S. workers.Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the immigration system, calling for companies to hire more Americans instead of outsourcing jobs to countries with cheaper labor or bringing in lower-paid foreign workers.&#xA0;Silicon Valley&#x2019;s biggest tech companies, many of which were founded or run by immigrants, depend on H-1Bs and say efforts to thwart immigration threaten innovation, recruitment and startup formation. Trump&#x2019;s executive orders restricting travel from a handful of Muslim-majority nations led to unprecedented opposition from the industry.Read more: A Q&amp;A explainer on the fight over U.S. visasBut there&#x2019;s also broad recognition that reform is needed, given several high-profile examples where American employees have been replaced by lower-paid foreign workers through the program. Advocates for immigrants&#x2019; rights also argue H-1B workers are easily exploited because their legal status is tied to a particular employer. The Economic Policy Institute estimated there were about 460,000 people working on H-1B visas in 2013.This week&#x2019;s moves weren&#x2019;t the administration&#x2019;s first attempts to adjust the program. Last month, the immigration department suspended a system that expedited visa processing for certain skilled workers who paid extra. But people who have been pushing for reform had become frustrated in recent weeks that the Trump administration wasn&#x2019;t moving fast enough.Outsourcing firms are considered the worst abusers of the system, an impression that the tech industry has been happy to encourage. Monday&#x2019;s USCIS announcement targets those firms, with the agency saying it will focus inspections on workplaces with the largest percentage of H-1B workers, and those with employees who do IT work for other companies. Shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd., Wipro Ltd. and Accenture Plc each slipped more than 1 percent on Monday.Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., Cognizant, Wipro and Accenture didn&#x2019;t respond to requests to comment. Infosys declined to comment, while Tata Consulting Services Ltd. said it has reduced use of high-skilled H-1B visas, while creating more U.S. IT services jobs.&#x201C;Each of these steps are small steps by themselves,&#x201D; said&#xA0;R Chandrashekhar, president of the trade group Nasscom, which represents many India tech firms. &#x201C;What we are waiting to see is how they will tighten the process.

As renewable energy technologies such as solar panels become cheaper, microgrids have emerged as an option to more people.Helping provide energy access is a method to tie corporate social responsibility together with business development at companies peddling electronic services and devices. Providing power to people off the grid could eventually open up large new markets for computers and social networks.MIA has signed up more than a dozen implementing partners and observers.

With the sweep of a single executive order, President Donald Trump unwound the Obama-era framework of regulations designed to combat climate change and announced that he was &#x201C;putting an end to the war on coal.&#x201D;But not everyone in high-tech is ready to return to the age of fossil fuels. Mike Cassidy, who was formerly vice president at Alphabet&apos;s X research lab and headed&#xA0;Project Loon, its high-altitude balloon-based internet access initiative, is ready to try the nuclear option.Though Cassidy remains an advisor at Google, he has quietly started a new company, Apollo Fusion. On Friday, a website for the firm, which previously consisted only of a definition of the phrase &#x201C;nuclear fusion,&#x201D; was updated to include a vision statement that gives a tantalizing peek into Cassidy&apos;s plans.&#x201C;We&apos;re working on revolutionary hybrid reactor technology with fusion power to serve safe, clean, and affordable electricity to everyone,&#x201D; reads the site. &#x201C;Apollo Fusion power plants are designed for zero-consequence outcomes to loss of cooling or loss of control scenarios and they cannot melt down.&#x201D;The website asserts that Apollo Fusion&apos;s reactors will be inexpensive to build, cost competitive with traditional means of generating electricity, and flexible enough to serve both small villages and large cities. It says Cassidy is working with Ben Longmier, the founder of a company called Aether Industries, which made equipment for high-altitude research and was acquired by Apple in 2015. Longmier also has a PhD in plasma physics and advanced degrees in physics and nuclear engineering.When contacted last week about the new venture, Cassidy was spare with details of the company&#x2019;s plans though not with his pointed views on clean energy and the environment.&#x201C;I believe that global warming is real and I believe we are just dumping tons and tons of CO2 into our atmosphere that is heating up the globe,&#x201D; says Cassidy, who started and sold four separate technology startups over the past 20 years, including an instant messaging service for gamers, a search engine and an online travel site Ruba, which Google acquired in 2010. &#x201C;Environmentalists have struggled for a while over whether nuclear power is good or bad. I think most of the more thoughtful environmentalists now view nuclear as good. If you can find a way to do nuclear power that doesn&apos;t have the downsides, the risky, runaway meltdowns, or things like that, it&apos;s a real win for the planet.&#x201D;Only a few nuclear power plants have been constructed in North America over the last few decades, as politicians and communities worried about accidents like Fukushima and 3 Mile Island and the implications of terrorist attacks like 9/11 aimed at nuclear facilities. Apollo Fusion&#x2019;s technology appears to be designed to assuage those fears. It&#x2019;s developing a &#x201C;subcritical hybrid reactor&#x201D;&#x2014;a fusion-fission reactor that doesn&apos;t a achieve sustained nuclear reaction and that draws neutrons from other sources, such as deuterium, an isotope that has an extra neutron a"

Some experts in the field say the technology isn&apos;t up to scratch yet, but that if any company can solve the problem at hand, it&apos;s the online search giant.&#xA0;Some of the world&apos;s biggest marketers halted YouTube spending this month after ads from large brands were found running alongside hateful and extremist videos. Google parent Alphabet Inc. risks losing $750 million in revenue this year from the debacle, analysts at Nomura Instinet estimated this week. That&apos;s less than 1 percent of projected sales this year, so it&#xA0;can weather the financial storm. But it&apos;s likely an incentive for the company to re-direct AI investments and accelerate research efforts already underway.&#xA0;To detect and police content across YouTube&apos;s sprawling library, and ensure ads don&apos;t run against questionable content, Google must solve an AI problem no one has cracked yet: automatically understanding everything that&apos;s going on in videos, including gesticulations and other human nuances. (We explore the YouTube uproar, and its intersection with the ad industry and AI, on this week&apos;s Decrypted&#xA0;podcast;&#xA0;subscribe here on iTunes.)A potential solution lies in machine learning, a powerful AI technique for automatically recognizing patterns across reams of data -- a Google specialty. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has pledged to infuse the technology across all its products, and the company touts its abilities in the field to software developers, cloud-computing clients, advertisers and shareholders. &#xA0;Computer scientists doubt technology&#xA0;alone can expunge offensive videos.&#xA0;&quot;We&apos;re not there yet where we can, say, find all extremist content,&quot; said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth professor and senior adviser to the Counter Extremism Project, which has repeatedly called on YouTube to tackle this problem. He recommends companies like Google and Facebook Inc. deploy more human editors to filter content. &quot;Machine learning, AI is nowhere near that yet,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&apos;t believe the hype.&quot;&#xA0;The AI hype machine is running at full speed in Silicon Valley right now, as startups and technology giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft compete to recruit engineers and scientists skilled in the field.&#xA0;Google&apos;s AI advances sometimes match the hype, but they are not perfect. The company&apos;s cloud division recently released a tool (unrelated to YouTube) that breaks videos into their constituent parts, rendering them &quot;searchable and discoverable.&quot; A group of academics published research earlier this week that showed how to deceive this system&#xA0;by injecting images into videos.Google has used machine learning and other AI tools to master speech, text and image recognition. In 2012, researchers famously got a network of 16,000&#xA0;computers to teach itself to recognize cats by scanning millions of still images culled from&#xA0;YouTube videos. Understanding&#xA0;entire videos is a lot more difficult. Cats meow, stretch and jump through more than a thousand video frames each minute.&quot;A video is three dimensional, with two dimensions in space and an additional dimension in time,&quot; said Jiebo Luo, an AI expert at the University of Rochester, who has created text-based hate speech filters for social media like Twitter. &quot;It&apos;s a challenge.&quot; Particularly so for something as big as YouTube.

Melee&#x201C;With games, you can generate as much data as you like,&#x201D; says Demis Hassabis, chief executive officer of DeepMind Technologies Ltd., the London AI company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc. &#x201C;You want to hit the sweet spot, not too hard and not too easy for your current algorithms.&#x201D; Over the past three years, DeepMind has trained software to master Atari games and beat the world&#x2019;s best players at go, a strategic board game popular in Asia.Game environments are ideal for what&#x2019;s known as reinforcement learning, says John Schulman, a researcher at nonprofit lab OpenAI, which is backed by the likes of Tesla Inc.&#x2019;s Elon Musk, Y Combinator co-founder Sam Altman, and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Reinforcement learning means the machines figure out proper sequences of actions through processes of trial and error. Again, the controlled environment helps: It&#x2019;s much safer to teach an algorithm how to drive with a racing game than with your car. An engineer at Otto, the driverless-truck company owned by Uber Technologies Inc., has tried teaching AI software to play Grand Theft Auto V, as has a team from Intel Corp.&#x201C;We are very interested in what happens when you have several intelligent agents in the same environment. How do they interact? Can they learn to cooperate?&#x201D; &#x2014;Katja Hofmann, the Microsoft researcher who helped create Project MalmoHassabis says DeepMind has focused on games because it believes true general AI will have to understand its presence in a physical landscape. The simulated environments in games are a way to do this without having to build robots, which can be a pain in the ass, he says: &#x201C;They are slow. They break. You can&#x2019;t run faster than real time. You can&#x2019;t run millions of them in parallel.&#x201D;Some influential executives have turned their noses up at game research. &#x201C;We are not pursuing AI to beat humans at games,&#x201D; Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said at his company&#x2019;s developers conference in September. Instead, he said, Microsoft had staked much of its future on AI as a means to help solve &#x201C;the most pressing problems of our society and economy.&#x201D; Chris Bishop, who heads Microsoft&#x2019;s AI research lab in Cambridge, England, says making competitive games the benchmark for AI also reinforces fears that smart computers threaten people.That said, Microsoft has created Project Malmo, an AI research environment based on the video game Minecraft, which it happens to own. Bishop says Minecraft doesn&#x2019;t feed the man-vs.-machine narrative because it has no set objectives and isn&#x2019;t necessarily competitive.Knocks on the gaming model haven&#x2019;"
